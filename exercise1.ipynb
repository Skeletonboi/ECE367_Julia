    "In this exercise prepared by me (Mohannad Shehadeh), I'll be demonstrating the power of projections through a variety of examples. The purpose of the exercise is for you to see how much you can do using just the basic tools that you already know as well as to motivate the upcoming material in the course. The hope is that very soon, you'll come across a problem where you can apply the techniques illustrated in this exercise to do something cool. I'll assume that you're familiar with most of the ideas already, but I'll briefly review the basic facts that you should keep in mind as you go through the exercise. If any of them seem unfamiliar or don't make sense to you, I recommend you spend some time studying your lecture notes or textbook first, or reviewing your linear algebra. If you complete and understand Parts 1 and 2, Parts 3 and 4 can be completed by pretty much copying and pasting your code, so be sure to take your time to understand fully the first parts. There's very little code to write beyond implementing the Gram-Schmidt procedure which itself should only take a few lines of code. Moreover, you should be sure to understand fully the examples in Part 0 since you can reuse the code from the examples to do almost everything you'll need to do in the exercise."

    "We'll start by reviewing some facts and terminology that I'll be using:\n",
    "- A vector space, or a subspace of a vector space, can be represented as the span of a collection of vectors, perhaps the columns of some matrix $\\mathbf V$\n",
    "- These vectors may or may not be linearly independent\n",
    "- If these vectors are linearly independent, they are called a basis for that subspace and every vector $\\mathbf x$ in that subspace can be represented uniquely as a linear combination of these vectors, i.e., the columns of $\\mathbf V$\n",
    "- If $\\mathbf b$ is a vector of the coefficients of this linear combination $\\mathbf x = \\mathbf V \\mathbf b$\n",
    "- If the columns of $\\mathbf V$ are a basis for some subspace of higher dimensional space, in which case $\\mathbf V$ is a tall matrix, a vector $\\mathbf x$ in this higher dimensional space can be projected onto the span of the columns of $\\mathbf V$\n",
    "- The projection $\\mathbf{\\hat x}$ can then be represented as $\\mathbf{\\hat x} = \\mathbf V \\mathbf b$ for some lower dimensional vector $\\mathbf b$\n",
    "- The projection $\\mathbf{\\hat x}$ will be the closest (in Euclidean distance) vector to $\\mathbf x$ which lives the subspace spanned by the columns of $\\mathbf V$\n",
    "- In this case $\\mathbf b$ will be refered to either as the \"projection coefficients\" or the \"representation of the projection in terms of $\\mathbf V$\" and will provide a lower dimensional representation of $\\mathbf x$\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{\\hat x}$ is of the same size as $\\mathbf x$, but, given $\\mathbf V$ we can reproduce $\\mathbf{\\hat x}$ using a lower dimensional vector $\\mathbf b$ so we are sometimes just interested in the lower dimensional representation $\\mathbf b$\n",
    "- Suppose, for example, we wish to compare many high dimensional $\\mathbf x$. Once projected onto an appropriate subspace, we can instead compare the corresponding lower dimensional $\\mathbf b$ vectors.\n",
    "- The projection becomes very easy to compute when we have an orthonormal basis for our subspace. \n",
    "- An orthonormal basis is a basis (a linearly independent set), in which the vectors are orthogonal and normalized to have a norm of $1$ each\n",
    "- If a collection of vectors is orthogonal, then they are also linearly independent. Therefore, any orthogonal set of vectors is a basis for the subspace they span\n",
    "- Given any collection of vectors, whether or not they are a basis, we can construct an orthonormal basis for their span using the Gram-Schmidt procedure\n",
    "- Once we have an orthonormal basis $\\{\\mathbf{w_1}, \\dots, \\mathbf{w_m}\\}$ for our subspace spanned by the columns of $\\mathbf V$, we can have the basis vectors be the columns of some matrix $\\mathbf W$. \n",
    "- If we want to project $\\mathbf x$ onto the span of the columns of $\\mathbf W$ which is equal to the span of the columns of $\\mathbf V$, the projection coefficients $\\mathbf a$ are simply \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\mathbf{a} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "    \\langle \\mathbf{w_1}, \\mathbf{x} \\rangle \\\\\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "- Therefore, we have $\\mathbf{\\hat x} = \\mathbf W \\mathbf a = \\mathbf W \\mathbf{W^T} \\mathbf x$\n",
    "- If the columns of $\\mathbf V$ were also a basis (linearly independent), then we can also find a $\\mathbf b$ the same size as $\\mathbf{a}$, but different, such that $\\mathbf{\\hat x} = \\mathbf W \\mathbf a = \\mathbf W \\mathbf{W^T} \\mathbf x = \\mathbf V \\mathbf b$\n",
    "- In this case, $\\mathbf a$ is the representation of the projection in our orthonormal basis, and $\\mathbf b$ is the representation of the projection in our non-orthogonal, non-orthonormal basis\n",
    "- If the the columns of $\\mathbf V$ are not a basis (they are linearly dependent), then certainly we can represent a projection onto their span as $\\mathbf{\\hat x} = \\mathbf V \\mathbf b$, but the $\\mathbf b$ will not be unique so we do not talk of it as a \"representation.\" If we would like to talk about \"representations,\" we'll need to find a basis, or an orthonormal basis for that span"
